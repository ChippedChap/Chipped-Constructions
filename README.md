# Chipped-Constructions
A minecraft plugin that lets permitted users save a collection of blocks into a file and place it somewhere in the world at any time.

It is reccomended that you read ConstructBlock.java first, ConstructCuboid.java second and Constructions.java last in order to know the definitions of objects/methods before it is used in the next class.
